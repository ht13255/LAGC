# LAGC
LAGC is a CPU-optimized Python library for quantum photonics. It features a Loss-Aware Graph Compiler for large-scale MBQC. Using XOR-based graph surgery and recursive tensor slicing, LAGC bypasses GPU VRAM limits to simulate thousands of qubits on standard RAM. Perfect for photon loss recovery and high-fidelity circuit verification at scale.
